## Why

Owner after downloading 47 over Wi-Fi: the animation stuttered, the screen showed no progress and nothing said that
the download was done; wanted progress and download speed. Found: Reborn skips the platform refresh while any
platform task runs, so the percentage never moved; the stage reply showed nothing; after the 18 s download (58.7 MB,
≈3.3 MB/s) the player decoded the package twice (`check`, then `queue`) for 24 s with nothing new on screen.

| Change | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Platform | Live progress in `/run/y2/update-progress.json` (RAM, ≤4/s: phase, bytes, speed over 4 s, seconds left); the queue's decoding check writes `/run/y2/update-check-progress`. One decoding pass instead of two (about 12 s less; the queue still refuses a wrong-slot boot image). Download and check at nice 10. No per-MiB journal writes on Y2DATA. |
| Reborn | Reads both files five times a second while a download runs. Screen: *Step 1 of 2 · Download* / *Step 2 of 2 · Check*, large percentage, a bar that glides between reports with a moving highlight, MB of MB and speed, time left (in fives, then minutes); *Connecting…* with a sweeping segment before the first report. At the end the page turns to **Ready to Install** at once and a notice says *Update downloaded. Ready to install.* wherever the owner is; a failed download says nothing was changed. |

Previews: Reborn `reborn-preview` states `34-update-downloading`, `34b-update-download-progress`,
`34c-update-download-check`.

## Owner steps

1. First 47's test (installed from the queue, five recovery probes).
2. Publish 48; install it over Wi-Fi. That download still uses 47's screen; 48's screen shows from the next
   download on (or a development reinstall published for the test).
