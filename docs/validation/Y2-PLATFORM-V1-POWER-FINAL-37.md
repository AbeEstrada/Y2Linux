# POWER-FINAL-37 — recovery replay fix and the warm-restart display snapshot

Status: **SEALED, awaiting the owner flash** (2026-10-15). Package
`out/y2linux-platform-v1-power-final-candidate-37/` (fallback = 35, which the player runs), receipts
`out/deep-sleep-final/build37-receipts/`. BOOTIMG `7167dd4ad22ec5690a1e1ce3ba5620ebd661821face1431478f653c67f9b048d`,
Y2ROOT `2cfdef294fbc7f5f99bd8240de599a28d042d0c1e63ad7b140155cf9247f3082`, RECOVERY
`7c789d9ea8b4900022ff20fe8e107b69ab7242832f566e9dd354537ce17a16e2`. Kernel `6.18.56-y2linux-platform-v1-power-final-37`,
release `1.0.0-platform-v1-power-final-candidate.37`, update sequence 3700. Container suite **718 OK**, all seal checks
PASS. 36 (status fix only) was never installed; 37 contains it.

## Why

| Found on the device | Fix in 37 |
| --- | --- |
| 35 → 36 install: the recovery refused its own release (`failed_unchanged`, `downgrade/replay refused`, nothing written). The recovery image written by `prepare` is the new release's, whose compat file names the package's sequence. | The recovery checks replay against the sequence the normal system recorded when it queued the package (regression test with a release key). |
| `y2-platform update status` called the schema-2 journal unreadable (Reborn could not install; health would never acknowledge). | Python accepts journal schema 2; an unpublished channel (404) means up to date. |
| A software restart (boot_reason 4) leaves the panel dark (archives 130/131): DSI/PHY registers equal a cold start, but OVL never completes and RDMA never reports done; vblank stays 1. The owner saw LK's logo on the restart. REA of the FM LK (`platform_init` 0x81e004b8): display init and logo run with no boot-reason branch. | Read-only display-path snapshot at `/sys/kernel/debug/y2_display_snapshot`: two samples of MMSYS, OVL, RDMA, MUTEX, SMI larb0/common, DSI, MIPI TX, APMIXED PLLs, INFRACFG, TOPCKGEN and SPM power status, for a cold/warm diff. |

## Owner steps

1. Flash 37 (preserve scatter: BOOTIMG + ANDROID; RECOVERY optional — the install test writes 37's recovery
   anyway). The first boot is a cold start: the agent saves its snapshot (archive 133).
2. With the owner's OK: one software restart (`y2-platform shutdown reboot`). The panel will probably stay dark;
   the agent saves the warm snapshot over SSH, then the owner holds Power 10 s.
3. Install test: `…-37-ota-devtest` staged on the device, Turn Off and Install in Reborn (now enabled), Power,
   watch the progress, Power. The agent checks `Acknowledged`, readback and timing.
