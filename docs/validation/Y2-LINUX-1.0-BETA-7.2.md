## Since Beta 7.1 (Reborn)

Owner (2026-10-16): more animation to make the UI feel polished and responsive, at 60 fps; the Now Playing progress as a
"cool" wave, not a perfect sine. Reborn `634f83a`.

| Part | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Motion system | `crates/reborn-ui/src/motion.rs`: per-key eased values (exponential, ≈125–190 ms), retargetable at any moment, frame-rate independent, settled values stop all redrawing. Anything moving keeps Cover Flow's 60-fps path (12-ms frame gap, Interactive CPU lease). Off in previews and tests (`Ui::ui_motion`); `reborn-preview --motion` captures frames mid-animation. |
| Lists and focus | Shared components mark moving quads (`canvas::Moving`): the focus row and Home's marker glide; Artists, Songs, Genres, search, Up Next, Folders, Playlists and the radio lists scroll smoothly (one row more on each side, hidden at rest; the status bar stays above); a long wheel jump glides only its last row. |
| Screens, menus, messages | New screens slide in from the right, Back slides out (200 ms, ease-out); sheets rise over a fading scrim; dialogs and toasts fade in; switches slide their knob and blend their colour. |
| Now Playing | The position moves on between reports; the progress is a travelling wave (two sines, breathing height, tapered ends, opaque 2.6-px strokes with a faint 5-px edge) that lies flat when paused; a new song fades in; the play button dips on a change. Continuous 60 fps while playing and visible. |

Host evidence: 487 Reborn tests (new: motion springs, wave while playing / flat when paused, focus glide, slide with one focus
target, long jumps), strict Clippy, fmt; mid-animation captures compared by eye. Device frame rate not yet measured.

## Device checks owed (after the owner's over-the-air install)

1. Frame rate with the control-socket sampler (`metrics`, `graphics_frames` per second): list scrolling, focus glide,
   screen slides and Now Playing while playing should hold ≈60 fps; at rest no frames.
2. The wave travels while playing and lies flat on pause; fast wheel scrolling stays immediate.
3. Battery: Now Playing visible while playing redraws continuously; check the CPU lease ends when the screen is off.
4. Still open: Beta 7.1 checks (USB screen, update answer, automatic time zone), Beta 7 checks.

## Known gaps

FM radio (Beta 8); no 12/24-hour switch; sleep ≈7.8–9.4 mA vs stock ≈1.3 mA; Bluetooth range hardware-limited; no
headphone-jack detection.
