# POWER-FINAL-42 — reopen the SMI gates before a software restart

Status: **SEALED, awaiting the owner flash** (2026-10-16). Package `out/y2linux-platform-v1-power-final-candidate-42/`
(fallback = 41), receipts `out/deep-sleep-final/build42-receipts/`. BOOTIMG

release `…candidate.42`, update sequence 4200. Container suite **718 OK**, all seal checks PASS. Signed OTA (release
key): `…-42-ota-release/`.

## Why

41 confirmed that a software restart leaves the SMI common gate closed (archive `20261016/142`), but opening it at
the next handover is too late: LK's request issued while the clock was off stays stuck in larb0. 42 adds a restart
handler (priority 255, before the watchdog handler, after all drivers have shut down) in `mm-clocks.c` that reopens
SMI common and larb0 (`MMSYS_CG_CLR0` = 3) when the DIS domain is powered, so LK starts from the cold-start state.
41's handover opener and the snapshots stay.

## Owner steps

1. Flash 42 (BOOTIMG + ANDROID).
2. With the owner's OK: one software restart. Expected: panel lit, larb0 idle at handover, **no** `SMI gates` line.
3. Then `/data/updates/restart.json` `{"mode": "reboot"}` and an install with no Power presses.
