# POWER-FINAL-39 — display mutex reset for the software restart; smoother update screen

Status: **SEALED, awaiting the owner** (2026-10-15). Package `out/y2linux-platform-v1-power-final-candidate-39/`
(fallback = 38), receipts `out/deep-sleep-final/build39-receipts/`. BOOTIMG
`e3ba4a51f4b0009db518739348fd97b6b061307647a4f4b1e0e46e0f53ead3ee`, Y2ROOT
`304057726d8e0fd02a73feaf4f173b33a53c33f5a0e495ecc8e736d5f1e55803`, RECOVERY
`dca8076362830f8c4683e5276f8128d57c3bb04c080c58bb752103ac8d31ac65`. Kernel `6.18.56-y2linux-platform-v1-power-final-39`,
release `1.0.0-platform-v1-power-final-candidate.39`, update sequence 3900. Container suite **718 OK**, all seal checks
PASS. Signed OTA (release key): `…-39-ota-release/`.

## Why

38's stock restart sequence (external reset) did **not** fix the dark panel after `y2-platform shutdown reboot`
(archive `20261015/135`, boot_reason 4, vblank stuck at 1). Snapshot diff against the cold start just before
(archive 134): DSI and MIPI TX equal; the overlay FIFO full (`OVL_RDMA0_CTRL` `0x03ff0001` vs `0x00080001`), OVL
flow/RDMA debug stuck, the mutex block with a timeout flag (`INTSTA` `0x10000101` vs `0x10000001`) and a pending
commit (`REG_COMMIT` 8 vs 0), and Linux logging `could not acquire mutex 0` 33 s after boot: its first frame is never
committed. On a cold start the same full FIFO clears with Linux's first frame (0.6 s).

| Change | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Mutex handover | First mutex prepare per boot pulses `MUTEX_RST` for all six mutexes and clears `INTSTA` (vendor register map), logging `Y2SCAN mutex reset: intsta … commit …`. |
| Recovery screen | Double-buffered with page flips at vblank (owner: flicker); activity as dots after the step name instead of a moving mark in the bar (owner: looked like a second bar). |

## Owner steps

1. Flash 39 (BOOTIMG + ANDROID; the kernel changed). The agent checks the `mutex reset` line on the cold boot.
2. With the owner's OK: one software restart. Panel lit → `restart.json` on and an install without Power presses
   (39's OTA package or a reinstall). Panel dark → hold Power; diff the snapshots again.
