# POWER-FINAL-26 — Bluetooth codec auto-selection

Status: **INSTALLED, BLUETOOTH CODEC CHECK OPEN** (2026-10-13; archive 121). Package `out/y2linux-platform-v1-power-final-candidate-26/`
(fallback = 25), receipts `out/deep-sleep-final/build26-receipts/`. BOOTIMG

`66efd3ed0d4f727edeffa9dd6571f3d9c3e4ebe02647d8074b04c7cf09c2405f`. Identity: build `Y2LINUX-PLATFORM-V1-POWER-FINAL-26`,
kernel `6.18.56-y2linux-platform-v1-power-final-26`, root `2026.08-platform-v1.56`, release
`1.0.0-platform-v1-power-final-candidate.26`; Linux `64b3cc4`, **Reborn `1c9edd4`**. Platform as 25.

## 25 on the device (first check, archives 119–120)

Boot `f0cc8b34` healthy, taint 0, DSI hand-over dark (`backlight off until the first Linux frame` → `restored`). The
owner's card now scans complete: 311 files discovered, 0 failures (24: "11 traversal failures"). Cover Flow frame rate
not measured (the owner filmed it instead; the sampler caught only one 60-fps burst). The framebuffer stream tool reads
≈10 fps whatever the transport (raw 9.8, gzip 9.3; SSH chacha20 carries ≈19 MB/s), so it cannot show a 60-fps glide.

## Why only SBC was chosen

The platform already starts BlueALSA with every compiled codec (`--codec=AAC --codec=aptX --codec=aptX-HD
--codec=LDAC`, `/run/y2/codec-runtime.json`). Live `org.bluealsa.Manager1.Codecs` = `A2DP-source:SBC`, `…:AAC`,
`…:aptX`, `…:aptX-HD`, `…:LDAC`. Reborn accepted only the lowercase prefix `a2dp-source:`, so every codec, SBC included,
was `runtime_enabled=false`; the policy failed (`no_eligible_codec_PHYSICAL_GATE_or_distribution_gate`), the codec
choice (Auto included) stayed hidden and the saved preference was the old default, SBC. The AirPods Pro were on AAC
only because BlueZ negotiated it at connect.

## What 26 changes (Reborn `1c9edd4`)

- The A2DP-source profile in `Codecs` matches case-insensitively (`a2dp_source_codecs`).
- Default codec preference is Auto: LDAC → aptX-HD → aptX → AAC among mutually usable codecs, SBC fallback, requested
  only while the PCM is idle (unchanged policy code).
- Sessions saved before `codec_revision` 1 that hold SBC (the old default; the choice was never offered) move to Auto
  once; another saved codec, or SBC chosen afterwards, is kept.

## Tests

Reborn fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, workspace tests pass; the discovery test now uses the BlueALSA 5.0.0 names seen on
the Y2, and both codec tests fail without the fix. Platform: `validate.py` PASS, ELF closure 354 PASS, installed ARM
PASS, privacy clean, inventory 108 packages, container suite 693 OK.

## Owner checks after the flash

1. Settings → Bluetooth codec shows Auto, SBC, AAC for the AirPods Pro; Auto selected.
2. Status `bluetooth.codec_policy`: `runtime_enabled` true for all five, `selected`/`pcms[0].codec` AAC after a
   reconnect with playback stopped.
3. aptX / aptX-HD / LDAC need headphones that offer them (NOT_RUN).

## 26 on the device (archive 121, boot `9f7fe545`)

Kernel `…power-final-26`, taint 0, Reborn running with the new session (`codec_preference` Auto, `codec_revision` 1:
the SBC → Auto migration worked). **The owner could not play music:** Reborn's output was still the AirPods Pro
(`14:14:7D:AA:34:47`) and every play press failed with `operation_failed "connected A2DP peer required"`. The AirPods
were paired, bonded and trusted but never connected this boot: the platform reconnect (`/run/y2/bt-reconnect.json`)
made two `ConnectProfile` calls, both ended without a reply (`completion_unknown_user_retry_required`), so automatic
reconnect is `Inhibited` until a manual connect (`tools/connectivity/reconnect.c`, unchanged since 25). Reborn
metrics: 0 Bluetooth connects, 0 disconnects; `pcms` empty, `codec_policy` none; codec history unchanged since 25
(last negotiated AAC). So 26's codec code never ran; the likely cause is the AirPods being in their case, out of
range or held by the phone at boot.

Still open (device was unplugged for the overnight test before a manual connect was checked):

- Manual connect (Settings → Bluetooth → AirPods Pro → Connect) works and lifts the inhibit.
- Auto then requests AAC (26 is the first image that actually issues `SelectCodec` on connect) **without dropping the
  link**; watch `metrics.bluetooth_disconnects` and the log right after the connect. If the request drops the link:
  skip `SelectCodec` when the negotiated codec already equals Auto's choice.
- Design gap regardless of 26: when the saved Bluetooth output is not connected, Reborn only reports "connected A2DP
  peer required"; it neither retries the connect on play nor falls back to the Y2's own output.
