# POWER-FINAL-31 — folder-first artwork and metadata formats

Status: **SEALED, AWAITING THE OWNER FLASH** (2026-10-14). Package `out/y2linux-platform-v1-power-final-candidate-31/`
(fallback = 30), receipts `out/deep-sleep-final/build31-receipts/`. BOOTIMG
`9aeeba7899f47b3d137f664f3ae0d20e6a25cde76e87f14ec3a837b0012bb384`, Y2ROOT
`b275bf043f14979ffa6ffcf9a84f5882b9453c7da822879157c2de0078d6bf4f`. Identity: build `Y2LINUX-PLATFORM-V1-POWER-FINAL-31`,
kernel `6.18.56-y2linux-platform-v1-power-final-31`, root `2026.08-platform-v1.61`, release
`1.0.0-platform-v1-power-final-candidate.31`; Linux `ebd2a58`, **Reborn `0892bf2`**. Contains 27–30 (30 was never
flashed; 31 supersedes it).

## What 31 changes (Reborn `0892bf2`)

- Artwork: the album folder's cover first, the embedded picture only when the folder has none (thumbnails, Cover
  Flow, Now Playing). Folder names by priority (any case, jpg/jpeg/png/webp): cover, folder, front, album, albumart,
  artwork; then Windows Media Player AlbumArt_{GUID}_Large / AlbumArtSmall; finally the only image in the folder.
  macOS `._*` never counts. Thumbnail cache renamed (`thumb2-`), old thumbnails removed once.
- Library extensions `.m4b`, `.oga`, `.aifc` (already supported by the image's FFmpeg); `.mp4` deliberately excluded.
- Vorbis/APE `ALBUM ARTIST` (with a space) read as album artist; `METADATA_REVISION` 4 re-reads every row's tags once.

Supported formats and the FFmpeg component list: scope audit "POWER-FINAL-31" in `docs/planning/roadmap-gap-audit.md`.

## Tests

Reborn workspace 379 (folder-over-embedded with a distinct cover, name priority / WMP / single-image fallback,
extensions, legacy thumbnail removal), clippy `-D warnings`, fmt. Platform: validate PASS, ELF 354, installed ARM,
privacy, inventory 108, container suite **711 OK**. Packaging/inventory ran from a checkout of the build commit (a
docs-only commit followed it).

## Owner checks after the flash

1. Album grid / Cover Flow show the folder image where both exist (first view rebuilds thumbnails).
2. The first library scan re-reads tags once (a few seconds); album artists tagged `ALBUM ARTIST` group correctly.
3. 30's checks: boot scan time, `noatime`, playback unchanged.
